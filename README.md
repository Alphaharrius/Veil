# Veil

Veil is planned to be a gradually typed, and multi-paradigm programming language supports both object-oriented & functional programming.

This project serves as an exercise on ```C++``` and a way to learn how a programming language with a runtime could work under the hood.
My current goal of this project is to complete the runtime, then implement a simple compiler in whatever language I feel comfortable in
(```Python``` or ```Java```), and re-implement the compiler in Veil language as a proof of principle.

Ofcoz there is a much harder quest to implement a just-in-time compiler targeting branches (or I should say it is a trace JIT), which
based on a exposed compiler interface in the runtime, so that we can support any type of compiler backend. The JIT will most likely be
built with a language with memory-safety, maybe in ```Rust``` or even in ```Veil``` itself...

## The Fabric runtime

The Fabric runtime is for running the Fabric bytecode generated by a compiler from the Veil code, and is implemented
by C++, is designed from the ground up to support multi-threaded environment. And to be fully embeddable into other ```C++```
projects, there will be no globally defined states.

To keep the code structure as clear as possible, I planned to use the fully power of OOP provided by ```C++```, and leave all rooms of
performance enhancements & optimizations to the JIT compiler.

Future prospects includes adding a JIT compiler, rewrite part of the VM service code base using Veil... etc.

### Code structure

- Integer like types in the code should use the ```typedef``` defined types in ```fabric/src/typedefs.hpp```.
- All error code of the VM runtime should be type ```uint32``` and reside in a namespace specific for their usage, and
  defined only in ```fabric/src/errors.hpp```.
- Except for special header files, all code under a subdirectory of ```fabric/src``` should be defined in a
  specific ```namespace```.
- All native or OS related platform specific code of a subdirectory of ```fabric/src``` should all be placed
  within ```os.hpp``` & ```os.cpp```, and reside in the namespace of ```veil::os```.
- Platform specific methods under the namespace of ```veil::os``` should all contain an error return
  parameter: ```some_native_method(..., uint32 &error)```.
- All ```class``` that will be part of the VM structure should either be a subtype of ```HeapObject```
  , ```Arenaobject``` or ```ValueObject```.
